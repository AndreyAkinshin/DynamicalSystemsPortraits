# Description #
The Rössler attractor is the attractor for the Rössler system, a system of three non-linear ordinary differential equations originally studied by Otto Rössler. These differential equations define a continuous-time dynamical system that exhibits chaotic dynamics associated with the fractal properties of the attractor.
